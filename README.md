# PC-ASSEMBLY

On 12 November 2025, I took part in a PC assembly laboratory session that focused on understanding the internal components of a personal computer and learning the proper methods for assembling and disassembling hardware components under the supervision of an instructor.

I worked in a group of five members. The session began with the disassembly process, where we opened the computer casing and carefully detached the cables connected to the motherboard, power supply unit (PSU), RAM, hard disk, and CPU fan using appropriate tools. After all components had been removed, we proceeded to reassemble the PC systematically by reinstalling each part in the correct order.

After completing the assembly, the computer was powered on to verify its functionality. The system booted successfully, indicating that all components had been installed correctly. At the conclusion of the laboratory session, a short quiz was conducted to assess our understanding of the PC assembly procedures.

Overall, this lab session improved my understanding of computer hardware by allowing me to identify key internal components and learn how hardware upgrades or modifications, such as installing additional RAM or storage devices, can be carried out to meet specific user needs.
